diamonds(machine learning).
## 1. create a folder where we save the csv files, called data.
https://github.com/Paulcorreafl/Project_m3/tree/main/data.
- Here we find the documents in csv, with which we are going to work from the start.
## 2 In the notebook folder is where we will do our analysis.
https://github.com/Paulcorreafl/Project_m3/tree/main/notebook.
- We extract the data from the csv.
- We proceed to do an EDA to have greater control of our data, for this we analyze them, so we can choose the best strategy.
- We proceed to test the model with 20% of the train csv, where all the information is found, and then test it with the test csv, which is the one we will upload to Kaggle.
- In this case we have tested different methods until we got the one that gave us the best results, this was a Random Forest Regressor.
- After several tests we have decided to eliminate the columns X,Y,Z, these had a strong relationship with Carter, so they basically gave us the same information.
- Finally we generate a new file.
## we upload the file to kaggle.
https://github.com/Paulcorreafl/Project_m3/tree/main/csv_project
- Once analyzed, we create a CSV file which only generates the ID and price columns. This is what we will upload to Kaggle.
